# Cloud-Computing-Final-Project
This is the repo associated to a Cloud Computing course of ESILV M1. <br>
We chose to create an interactive webapp, complete with an immersive UI and a connected database. This webapp is designed to provide a library of fantasy-themed item cards for the D&D 5E tabletop. It is aimed at fans of roleplay games and homebrew (fan-made content).
